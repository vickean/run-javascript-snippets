# run-javascript-snippets
JS snippets to use with Run Javascript Chrome Extension.

This is a collection of JS snippets that I've used to change UI elements for certain sites to suit my needs.

The class names that the snippets may change over time as the various sites get updated so I do not gaurantee that the snippets will work all the time.

Note: Run Javascript allows arbitrary JS to be run on a page, please review all code that you intend to run using this extension.
